# strace

Run `strace <command>` to get a trace of system calls and signals (including errors) for the command. This looks great for when you have an errno whose cause you can't guess.

Use `-f` to include child processes in the trace.

```bash
# To split child process traces into their own files
strace -ff -o x $CMD
# To trace an already-running process:
strace -p $PID
# To get timing information (-tt for absolute, -T for elapsed)
strace -tt -T $CMD
# To filter on particular system calls
strace -e $CALL1,$CALL2,$CALL3 $CMD
```
